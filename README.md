## Usage

Convert Temperature

From Celsius to Fahrenheit
```ruby
temperature_in_celsius = 25
Temperature.c_to_f(temperature_in_celsius) # => 77.0째F
```
From Fahrenheit to Celsius
```ruby
temperature_in_fahrenheit = 100
Temperature.c_to_f(temperature_in_fahrenheit) # => 37.78째C
```

You can also get the Freezing and Boiling points in 째F or C째

```ruby
Temperature::CELSIUS_FREEZING_POINT # => 0
Temperature::CELSIUS_BOILING_POINT # => 100
Temperature::FAHRENHEIT_FREEZING_POINT # => 32
Temperature::FAHRENHEIT_BOILING_POINT # => 212
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
